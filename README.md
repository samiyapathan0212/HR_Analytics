HR Analytics Dashboard | Employee Attrition Analysis (Python & Power BI)
This project performs end-to-end HR Analytics to analyze employee attrition using Python for data analysis and Power BI for interactive dashboards. The objective is to identify key factors influencing employee turnover and provide data-driven insights to support HR decision-making and workforce planning. The project demonstrates skills required for Data Analyst Intern, Business Analyst, and Power BI Developer roles.

Business Problem
Employee attrition negatively impacts organizations through increased hiring and training costs, loss of skilled workforce, and reduced productivity and team stability.
Problem Statement: Analyze employee data to identify attrition patterns and highlight factors contributing to employee turnover.

Tools, Technologies & Skills Used 
Programming & Analysis: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning & Preprocessing, Statistical Analysis
Data Visualization & BI: Power BI Desktop, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), KPI Design, Interactive Dashboards, Slicers & Filters, Drill-through Analysis
Data Analytics Concepts: HR Analytics, Employee Attrition Analysis, Workforce Analytics, Descriptive Analytics, Business Intelligence, Data Storytelling

Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Collection & Cleaning (Python): Loaded HR dataset (CSV format), checked and validated missing values and duplicates, removed redundant columns, created derived columns (Age Band, Income Band, Tenure Band), exported Power BI–ready cleaned dataset.
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Attrition distribution analysis, attrition by gender, department, job role, analysis of age, salary, tenure, and experience, correlation analysis of numerical features, identification of high-risk employee segments.
3️⃣ Power BI Dashboard Development: Built multi-page interactive Power BI dashboard, created KPI cards using DAX, designed business-focused visualizations, added slicers for dynamic filtering, implemented drill-down and detailed tables.

Key KPIs & Metrics
Total Employees, Attrition Count, Attrition Rate (%), Active Employees, Average Age, Average Monthly Income, Average Years at Company

Dashboard Pages Overview
Executive Summary: Overall attrition overview, attrition by department and job role, attrition by age band, income band, and tenure band, interactive slicers for business filtering.
Employee Demographics & Satisfaction: Job satisfaction analysis, work-life balance evaluation, environment satisfaction impact, distance from home analysis.
Detailed Employee Analysis: Attrition vs overtime analysis, employee-level drill-through table, total employees by attrition status.

Key Insights (HR Analytics Findings)
Employee attrition rate is approximately 16%. Employees aged 26–35 show higher attrition. Lower income groups experience higher turnover. Employees with 0–2 years of tenure are most likely to leave. Sales and R&D departments show higher attrition. Overtime work is strongly associated with employee exits. Lower job satisfaction increases attrition risk.

Business Recommendations
Improve onboarding and engagement programs for new employees. Review compensation strategy for lower salary bands. Reduce excessive overtime to prevent burnout. Focus retention strategies on high-attrition departments. Enhance employee satisfaction and work-life balance initiatives.

Project Outcome
This project demonstrates a strong foundation in data analysis and business intelligence, hands-on experience with Python EDA, ability to create professional Power BI dashboards, practical understanding of HR analytics and workforce insights, and an end-to-end data analytics workflow from raw data to business insights.

Future Enhancements
Time-series attrition trend analysis, predictive analytics using machine learning, advanced Power BI tooltips and bookmarks, automated reporting pipeline.
